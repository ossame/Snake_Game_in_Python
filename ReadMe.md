Game Features:

Simple and Intuitive Controls: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to guide the snake in the desired direction. The snake's movement is continuous, so think ahead to avoid obstacles and create a winning strategy.

Growing Snake: As the snake eats food, it increases in length, making the game progressively challenging. Can you manage a long snake without crashing?

Food Generation: Watch out for the randomly generated food items that appear on the game board. Each time the snake consumes food, you earn points, and the snake grows longer.

Collision Detection: Be cautious not to collide with the boundaries of the game board or the snake's own body. A collision means game over!

Score Tracking: Keep track of your progress with a real-time score counter. Challenge your friends and family to beat your high score.

Speed Increment: As you score more points, the game's speed increases, intensifying the challenge and testing your reflexes.

Graceful Graphics: Enjoy a simple yet captivating graphical interface, bringing back the charm of vintage gaming.
